# Planning Documents

This directory contains detailed planning documents for each feature.

Each planning document follows the format: `[feature-id]-[feature-name].md`

## Template Structure

Each planning document should include:

1. **Feature Overview** - Brief description
2. **Detailed Requirements** - Specific implementation requirements
3. **Technical Design** - Architecture, data structures, algorithms
4. **Task Breakdown** - Step-by-step implementation tasks
5. **Dependencies** - Other features or components needed
6. **Testing Plan** - How to verify the feature works
7. **Acceptance Criteria** - Clear definition of "done"

## Example

See the SDLC section in `claude.md` for the complete workflow.
